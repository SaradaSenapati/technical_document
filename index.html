                    Technical documentation describes how a product or service works, and can include its structure, purpose, and application. It can be written in a variety of formats, including text, video tutorials, and augmented reality applications. Technical documentation can be used by many different stakeholders, including engineers, marketers, and end users.
                </p>
                <p class="font">Put very simply, technical documentation is the part of product communication that explains the product and makes it possible for users to actually use it. It is therefore not about advertising and press releases, but “hard” facts. Technical documentation can look very different, of course, depending on the product.

                    <b>Introduction:</b><br> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces (API) and Document Object Model (DOM).

                    <b>What is CSS:</b><br>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and plays an important role in providing the styles to the HTML elements, which helps to make web pages presentable. 

                    CSS is essential for providing distinctive styles to elements and ensuring responsiveness across diverse screen sizes. Inline CSS commands the highest priority in styling. Web browsers implement the default styles to elements, which can be customized using CSS.

                <p class="font"> 
                    <b>Significance of Cascade : </b><br><br>

                    The Cascade is an algorithm that defines combining the property values that originate from different sources. The significance of Cascade is to prioritize & resolve the conflict issues for determining the order of the final styling that will be applied to the HTML element if there exist multiple stylings(cascade layer) for the same element. This helps to set the value for a property on an element according to precedence when declared.

                    JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language widely used in web development. It plays a crucial role in both front-end and back-end development, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences. Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is interpreted through web browsers, making it highly accessible and versatile. It is a loosely typed (or weakly typed) language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
                    <br>
                    <b>History of JavaScript:</b>
                    <br> 
                    JavaScript’s history began in 1993 with the creation of the first popular web browser, Mosaic. In 1994, Netscape, founded by Marc Andreessen, sought to make the web more interactive by adding a programming language to web pages. Brendan Eich was hired to develop this language, initially planning to use Scheme. However, after Netscape merged with Sun Microsystems, they decided to incorporate Java into their browser to compete with Microsoft. To avoid confusion between the new scripting language and Java, Netscape named the scripting language “LiveScript,” later changing it to “JavaScript” in December 1995. The first version was called “Mocha” by Marc Andreessen but was renamed to “JavaScript” due to trademark and other reasons.

                    Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language. Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.

                <p class="font">
                    Java’s history is as interesting as it is impactful. The journey of this powerful programming language began in 1991 when James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems known as the “Green Team,” set out to create a new language initially called “Oak.” Oak was later renamed Java, inspired by Java coffee, and was first publicly released in 1996 as Java 1.0. This initial version provided a no-cost runtime environment across popular platforms, making it accessible to a broad audience. Arthur Van Hoff rewrote the Java 1.0 compiler to strictly comply with its specifications, ensuring its reliability and cross-platform capabilities.

                    Java evolved over time, with Java 2 introducing multiple configurations tailored for different platforms, showcasing its versatility.
                    In 1997, Sun Microsystems aimed to formalize Java through the ISO standards body but eventually withdrew from the process.
                    Despite not formalizing through ISO, Sun Microsystems offered most Java implementations at no cost, earning revenue by licensing specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
                    A significant milestone in Java’s history occurred on November 13, 2006, when Sun Microsystems released a large portion of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as free, open-source software.
                    By May 8, 2007, the core JVM code was fully available under open-source distribution terms.
                    Java was designed with core principles: simplicity, robustness, security, high performance, portability, multi-threading, and dynamic interpretation. These principles have made Java a preferred language for various applications, including mobile devices, internet programming, gaming, and e-business.
                    Today, Java continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development, widely used across industries and platforms.
